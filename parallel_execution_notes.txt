1. We add 3 plugins in the pom
- failsafe : letting the tests execute safe even after some tests fails
- surefire : for parallel execution. We use parallel and thread-count keywords in plugin.
- cucumber-reporting : this generates extra detailed reports.
2. Create multiple runner => We create these runners for parallel execution
Normally we run our Runner class that we created before.
- TestRunner
- SmokeTestRunner
- RegressionTestRunner
3. Run from the Terminal while you are in the project directory.
- mvn clean verify
- mvn clean install
