=========================================
Database testing is done for making sure database data is working as expected
- Check if UI data exist in database
- Check if the database tables have expected data.
- For example, when user adds money to the bank account, then does it stored in the database
- For example, when customer is created a user account, does it stored in the database?
-----
Database is usually the most stable part of the application
And database should perform well so UI can work properly
For that reason database testing is done.
----------
Our database is postgresql database
